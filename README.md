# YaMovies — Flutter lecture 1 demo

This repository contains the tag-by-tag demo for the first Flutter lecture.
`lecture-1-finish` adds the lecture's local-state checkpoint. Stateful
`MovieListScreen` stores favorite movie ids in a `Set<int>` and rebuilds via
`setState()`, while each `MovieCard` remains stateless and reports taps through
a callback. Favorites are intentionally local and reset on app restart.

## Requirements

- Flutter 3.44.4 stable
- Dart 3.12.2

The exact Flutter version is pinned in `.fvmrc`:

```bash
fvm install 3.44.4
fvm flutter pub get
fvm flutter run
```

If FVM is not used, verify that `flutter --version` reports Flutter 3.44.4.

## Validate this tag

```bash
shasum -a 256 -c docs/tmdb_resources/SHA256SUMS
dart format --output=none --set-exit-if-changed lib test
flutter analyze
flutter test
```

## Resources and attribution

The fixture is a curated six-movie snapshot shaped like TMDB API v3 responses;
it is not a complete `/movie/top_rated` page. Resource provenance and checksum
instructions are in [docs/tmdb_resources/README.md](docs/tmdb_resources/README.md).

This product uses the TMDB API but is not endorsed or certified by TMDB.
